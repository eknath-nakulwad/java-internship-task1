# Java Console Calculator

A simple Java console application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with input validation.

## Features
- Add, subtract, multiply, divide two numbers.
- Handles decimal numbers.
- Checks for invalid input and division by zero.
- Menu-driven loop until user chooses to exit.

## Work
- Created static methods for arithmetic operations with method overloading (int and double types) to demonstrate OOP.
- Used Scanner for console input and a while loop for repeated calculations until user exit.
- Implemented switch statements for operator selection and try-catch blocks for exceptions (e.g., ArithmeticException for division by zero, InputMismatchException for non-numeric input).
- Ensured platform independence via JVM bytecode compilation.
- Debugged using print statements and tested edge cases like invalid operators.
